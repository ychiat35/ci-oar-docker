======================
Pydra: Dataflow Engine
======================

A simple dataflow engine with scalable semantics.

Pydra is a rewrite of the Nipype engine with mapping and joining as
first-class operations. It forms the core of the Nipype 2.0 ecosystem.

The goal of pydra is to provide a lightweight Python dataflow engine for DAG
construction, manipulation, and distributed execution.

Feature list:
=============
1. Python 3.7+ using type annotation and `attrs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/>`_
2. Composable dataflows with simple node semantics. A dataflow can be a node of another dataflow.
3. `splitter` and `combiner` provides many ways of compressing complex loop semantics
4. Cached execution with support for a global cache across dataflows and users
5. Distributed execution, presently via ConcurrentFutures, SLURM, and Dask (this is an experimental implementation with limited testing)

Installation
============

::

    pip install pydra


Note that installation fails with older versions of pip on Windows. Upgrade pip before installing:

::

   pip install â€“upgrade pip
   pip install pydra


Developer installation
======================

Pydra requires Python 3.7+. To install in developer mode:

::

    git clone git@github.com:nipype/pydra.git
    cd pydra
    pip install -e ".[dev]"


In order to run pydra's test locally:

::

    pytest -vs pydra


If you want to test execution with Dask:

::

    git clone git@github.com:nipype/pydra.git
    cd pydra
    pip install -e ".[dask]"



It is also useful to install pre-commit:

::

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit
